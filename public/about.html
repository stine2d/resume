  <h1>Hi! I'm Stine</h1>

  <p>I'm a creative focused on character design and sketch art. Right now, I'm building Stine2D creative studio to bring your creative visions to a (2D) reality. <br />
    I love a challenge outside my comfort zone as much as I enjoy if you already love my personal style! 
  </p>

  <p>Born and raised in Germany, I studied in the Netherlands and recently graduated with a BA in International Studies. The consultancy projects of my final year, 
    and a semester in Seoul, South Korea, brought on the connection between commission-based work and a knack for dreaming, pushing me to make my creativity my occupation.
  </p>

  <p>My journey to making the freelancing dream a reality has currently led me to build a web developer skillset. <br />
  Getting my feet off the ground into a remote-accessible occupation that I enjoy, will be the perfect runway to independently build and manage Stine2D creative studio! <br />
